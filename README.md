# Mailchimp Takehome Assignment Take 2

## Use the correct node version

```
nvm use
```

## Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Edge cases to test

- should be allowed to have spaces before the front of the line (headings will not work with this rn)
- how to handle linked headers
- should have links in the middle of paragraphs
- spaces in front of headers (stretch)
- Having a `#` in the middle of a header line
- single quotes must be replaced with `&#39;`. There are probably other characters for this to cover. Since the requirements dont mention this, I will only be replacing the single quote
