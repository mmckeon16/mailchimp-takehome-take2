## Edge cases to test

- ~~handle linked headers~~
- ~~should have links in the middle of paragraphs~~
- spaces in front of headers (stretch)
- would be good to have a browser test
- ~~Having a `#` in the middle of a header line~~
- ~~single quotes must be replaced with `&#39;`. There are probably other characters for this to cover. Since the requirements dont mention this, I will only be replacing the single quote~~
