<h1>Implement a Markdown => HTML converter</h1>
<p>Markdown is a simple syntax used to generate formatted text. It&#39;s used in lots of places, but the one most developers have probably encountered is README files in github.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we&#39;d like you to write a program which converts a small subset of markdown to HTML. You can implement this as a command-line program or as a web application, whatever you&#39;re more comfortable with.</p>
