<h1>Implement a Markdown => HTML converter</h1>
<p>Markdown is a simple syntax used to generate formatted text. It’s used in lots</p>
<p>of places, but the one most developers have probably encountered is README</p>
<p>files in github.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we’d like you to write a program which converts a small</p>
<p>subset of markdown to HTML. You can implement this as a command-line program</p>
<p>or as a web application, whatever you’re more comfortable with.</p>
